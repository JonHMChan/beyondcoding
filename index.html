						<li> 
							<p><strong>What is <em>Beyond Coding</em>?</strong></p>
							<p><em>Beyond Coding</em> is a free new summer program that sets out to equip emerging computer programmers in New York City with professional skills needed to help them succeed in their first job working with code. The program, slated to launch early July, is a direct response to the City's Tech Talent Pipeline efforts to grow our local tech ecosystem. <em>Beyond Coding</em> is a joint partnership among the following companies in New York City: Code to Work, Trello, Foursquare, American Express, Tumblr, Stack Overflow, and Codecademy.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><strong>Why was this program created in New York City?</strong></p>
							<p>With nearly <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/12/31/hiring-and-hirable-in-2013-agile-developers/" target="_blank">five open jobs</a> for every available software developer, the need for qualified technical talent is higher than ever. In New York City alone, there are currently <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/114-15/mayor-bill-de-blasio-nyc-tech-talent-pipeline-industry-partners-commitments-to" target="_blank">13,000 firms</a> hiring for highly sought-after skills, such as web development, mobile development, and user-interface design. To meet this demand, it’s critical to rapidly onboard more software developers to the workforce.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><strong>What’s the association between <em>Beyond Coding</em> and the NYC Tech Talent Pipeline?</strong></p>
							<p><em>Beyond Coding</em> was inspired by the mayor’s call to action to support the City's Tech Talent Pipeline, which is working to grow the city's tech ecosystem and prepare New Yorkers for 21st century jobs. We’ve developed this industry-led program as a way to support and amplify the Tech Talent Pipeline’s work in this arena.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><strong>I’m seeking my first job as a programmer, can I join <em>Beyond Coding</em>?</strong></p>
							<p>The 2016 <em>Beyond Coding</em> courses are generally only available to students involved in the Code to Work summer internship program at the moment. However, if you feel this course would greatly benefit you and you have completed a programming degree or bootcamp or similar undertaking, please contact us. We would be happy to discuss possible program entry.</p>
						</li>
