But, it is also a short summary used to quickly and simply define YOU.  How do you explain your value to prospective employers? How do you pitch yourself in casual settings? How do you pitch yourself while on an interview? How do you pitch yourself on social media? How do you pitch yourself to a reporter? How do you pitch yourself to your family? When should you alter your pitch?</p>

								<h3 class="h4">Working with Data</h3>
								<h4 class="h5">Kickstarter</h4>
								<p class="_small">Employing data-driven thinking has become an essential part of working at a tech company. Kickstarter's data team has developed a series of internal courses around data literacy to help newcomers to the field incorporate it into their day-to-day. This session will pull from those courses to give you an overview about how to think critically with data, tell data stories, and best represent it visually. You'll come away with a stronger understanding of the basics of data analysis and how to apply it to common business and technology challenges. No previous experience working with data is expected, but we hope participants will arrive curious and eager to think critically.</p>
