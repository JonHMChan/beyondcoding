								<p class="_small">Your coding career probably didn't start with a textbook, and it certainly won't end in a classroom setting. As a professional working with code, your field is constantly changing, and it's critical to stay current on the latest developments in technologies, emerging languages, and new tools and resources. In this course, we'll show you how to teach yourself on the job, how to know when to specialize or stay general, where to find resources online, and how to keep up with the craft of coding on the side. Though you may work in sprints, a career as a full-time developer is a marathon.</p>

								<ul>
									<li>Practice writing, saying, and adapting your personal pitch.</li>
									<li>Define what makes a pitch affective (and what makes one fail terribly).</li>
									<li>Define when you are “interviewing” (hint: always).</li>

Kickstarter's data team has developed a series of internal courses around data literacy to help newcomers to the field incorporate it into their day-to-day. This session will pull from those courses to give you an overview about how to think critically with data, tell data stories, and best represent it visually. You'll come away with a stronger understanding of the basics of data analysis and how to apply it to common business and technology challenges. No previous experience working with data is expected, but we hope participants will arrive curious and eager to think critically.</p>

								<h5>June 23, 2015 &amp; July 9, 2015</h5>
								<p class="_small">Did you know that 60-80% of career and business opportunities are found through meaningful and intentional networking? Though we live in a digital age where it can feel like our worth is defined by the number of social media connections we have, some can barely get 1% of their connections to respond directly to a poke, inquiry, email, or connection request. Yet, some can barely get 1% of their connections to respond directly to a poke, inquiry, or at times invitations.</p>

								<p class="_small">Let’s discuss the what, why, and how of networking. Join me in discovering how to expand your personal and professional network, which will increase your net worth, career opportunities, authentic relationships, and your personal brand without lifting your smartphone and enabling an app. Most importantly, let’s become comfortable entering a room full of unfamiliar faces, putting your best self forward, and discovering that most people you will encounter are in search for the very same thing: Connections that count.</p>

								<p class="_small"><em>To get the most out of this networking class, we would request that attendees wear clothing that would fit a "dressy casual" setting. This optional attire will help reinforce concepts to be covered, including appropriate clothing for job interviews and various professional settings. (Ie. For men: Seasonal sports coat or blazer for men, dress shirt or polo shirt, and no jeans. For women: Dress, skirt and dressy top, or dressy pants outfit, and no jeans.)</em></p>

					<h3>General</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p><strong>What is <em>Beyond Coding</em>?</strong></p>
							<p><em>Beyond Coding</em> is a free new summer program that sets out to equip emerging computer programmers in New York City with professional skills needed to help them succeed in their first job working with code. The program, slated to launch June 11, is a direct response to the City's Tech Talent Pipeline efforts to grow  our local tech ecosystem.. <em>Beyond Coding</em> is launching as a joint partnership among six companies in New York City’s startup ecosystem: Crest CC, Foursquare, Kickstarter, Tumblr, Trello, and Stack Overflow.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><strong>Why was this program created in New York City?</strong></p>
							<p>With nearly <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/12/31/hiring-and-hirable-in-2013-agile-developers/" target="_blank">five open jobs</a> for every available software developer, the need for qualified technical talent is higher than ever. In New York City alone, there are currently <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/114-15/mayor-bill-de-blasio-nyc-tech-talent-pipeline-industry-partners-commitments-to" target="_blank">13,000 firms</a> hiring for highly sought-after skills, such as web development, mobile development, and user-interface design. To meet this demand, it’s critical to rapidly onboard more software developers to the workforce.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><strong>What’s the association between <em>Beyond Coding</em> and the NYC Tech Talent Pipeline?</strong></p>
							<p><em>Beyond Coding</em> was inspired by the mayor’s call to action to support the City's Tech Talent Pipeline, which is working to grow the city's tech ecosystem and prepare New Yorkers for 21st century jobs. We’ve developed this industry-led program as a way to support and amplify the Tech Talent Pipeline’s work in this arena.</p>

					<h3>Student Q&amp;A</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p><strong>How can I join <em>Beyond Coding</em>?</strong></p>
							<p>Registration for Beyond Coding is now closed. Follow Beyond Coding on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/beyond-coding?trk=top_nav_home">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="http://beyondcodingnyc.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> to be informed about future projects.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><strong>I'm a current student and I have a scheduling conflict. Can I attend classes in the other track?</strong></p>
							<p>Yes, you may attend classes in the other track. However, due to capacity issues, you may only go to each class once.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><strong>I need help with my coursework. Where should I go?</strong></p>
							<p>We have a <a href="https://beyondcoding.slack.com/invite/NjAzMDc2NTA3NC0xNDMzNTI2NjI3LTE2ZTkwNTAyNGY">Beyond Coding Slack channel</a> where you can ask questions and get feedback from your fellow students. </p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><strong>How do I know if I would be a good fit for this program?</strong></p>
							<p>The <em>Beyond Coding</em> program is open to anybody in the New York City area who has experience and knowledge of programming, is currently looking for a job as a software developer or a related role, and who does not have access to tools, resources, or a professional network to lean upon for support.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><strong>Why do I need to apply?</strong></p>
							<p>We’re expecting a large number of participants to express interest in this program, and we want to make sure that we’re offering this opportunity to students who will be committed to seeing the program through to the end of the summer.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><strong>What if I don’t know how to code yet? Can I still participate?</strong></p>
							<p><em>Beyond Coding</em>’s goal is not to teach hard coding skills, but to ensure that anyone in this city with a passion for technology has access to the mentoring, training, and support they need to succeed as a developer. If you don’t yet have any programming experience, then <em>Beyond Coding</em> might not be the best fit for you. If you are interested in learning about tech training and education opportunities, please visit techtalent.nyc to learn more about NYC Tech Talent Pipeline  and  related opportunities to  gain “in-demand” tech sklls.  </p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><strong>How do I receive a certificate?</strong></p>
							<p>At the conclusion of this 10-week program, eligible students who attend at least five of the six courses and submit the required assignments will receive a formal certification of their course completion. You’ll also be introduced to top tech companies in New York City who are actively hiring junior-level developers as a way to get a headstart in your programming career.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><strong>How much does it cost to participate?</strong></p>
							<p>The Beyond Coding is free for all participants.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><strong>What type of companies will I be introduced to at the end of the program?</strong></p>
							<p>You can expect to meet a variety of enterprise companies and startups who are currently hiring junior-level developers in the New York City area. Prior to the meet-and-greet at the end of the program, you’ll receive a full list of participating companies.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><strong>Will I be considered for a job at one of the companies who are teaching courses as part of this program?</strong></p>
							<p>Generally speaking, most of the participating companies are not currently equipped to accommodate hiring junior-level technical talent. That said, having access to their employees and resources will help to improve your networking opportunities in New York City, both for your first programming job and for any career shifts you make in the future.</p>

				<article>
					<h3>Employer Q&amp;A</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p><strong>What skills and resources does Beyond Coding provide that other programs don’t address?</strong></p>
							<p>The curriculum is designed to accelerate the learning curve among new programmers by addressing skills gaps that employers often see when hiring junior level technical talent. Topics include professional networking, communicating technical topics to a variety of audiences, the best way to prepare for a technical interview, and techniques on how to continue learning programming skills beyond the classroom.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><strong>What types or roles will these students be equipped to apply for after this program?</strong></p>
							<p>These students will be prepared to take on an entry-level job as a developer, QA analyst, or other related role that requires technical knowledge.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><strong>How will students be measured for success during this program?</strong></p>
							<p>Participation is required to 5 out of 6 events; active participation will organically allow students to build relationships with <em>Beyond Coding</em> organizers and create opportunities for direct introductions to employers at the end of term hiring fair.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><strong>How much does it cost to attend the hiring fair?</strong></p>
							<p>It’s free for employers to participate in the “end of term” hiring fair. For more information on how to participate as an employer, contact <a href="mailto:employers@beyondcoding.io">employers@beyondcoding.io</a>.</p>
