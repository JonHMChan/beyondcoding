								<h5>August 4, 2015 &amp; August 6, 2015</h5>
								<p class="_small">In school, most projects are completed individually or in small groups. Your work is graded and requires no further explanation. As you move on to industry, you will be working with many people on far more complex projects. No matter what role you take at a tech company, you’ll need to continually communicate your ideas and contributions. In this course, you’ll learn about:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Getting people excited about your ideas.</li>
									<li>Speaking to audiences in various roles, both technical and non technical.</li>
									<li>Anticipating objections and listening to feedback.</li>

								<p class="_small">Let’s face it: mastering the art of a technical interview is not an easy feat but the Technical Recruiters at Tumblr are here to help guide you to success! In this course, you will learn from a recruiter’s first hand perspective on what they’ve seen successful candidates do in order to land their dream job. The recruiters will go over what you should or should not do from the moment you apply to signing your offer letter on the dotted line.</p>

								<h5>July 7, 2015 &amp; June 23, 2015</h5>
								<p class="_small">Your coding career probably didn't start with a textbook, and it certainly won't end in a classroom setting. As a professional working with code, your field is constantly changing, and it's critical to stay current on the latest developments in technologies, emerging languages, and new tools and resources. In this course, we'll show you how to teach yourself on the job, how to know when to specialize or stay general, where to find resources online, and how to keep up with the craft of coding on the side. Though you may work in sprints, a career as a full-time developer is a marathon.</p>

But, it is also a short summary used to quickly and simply define you. How do you explain your own value to prospective employers in 30 seconds? In this course we'll:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Practice writing, saying, and adapting your personal pitch.</li>
									<li>Define what makes a pitch affective (and what makes one fail terribly).</li>
									<li>Define when you are “interviewing” (hint: always).</li>
									<li>Learn how to recognize the cues to know it’s time to launch into your pitch.</li>

								<p class="_small">Employing data-driven thinking has become an essential part of working at a tech company. Kickstarter's data team has developed a series of internal courses around data literacy to help newcomers to the field incorporate it into their day-to-day. This session will pull from those courses to give you an overview about how to think critically with data, tell data stories, and best represent it visually. You'll come away with a stronger understanding of the basics of data analysis and how to apply it to common business and technology challenges. No previous experience working with data is expected, but we hope participants will arrive curious and eager to think critically.</p>

								<h4 class="h5">Crest</h4>
								<h5>June 23, 2015 &amp; June 25, 2015</h5>
								<p class="_small">Did you know that 60-80% of career and business opportunities are found through meaningful and intentional networking? Though we live in a digital age where it can feel like our worth is defined by the number of social media connections we have, some can barely get 1% of their connections to respond directly to a poke, inquiry, email, or connection request. Yet, some can barely get 1% of their connections to respond directly to a poke, inquiry, or at times invitations.</p>

								<p class="_small">Let’s discuss the what, why, and how of networking. Join me in discovering how to expand your personal and professional network, which will increase your net worth, career opportunities, authentic relationships, and your personal brand without lifting your smartphone and enabling an app. Most importantly, let’s become comfortable entering a room full of unfamiliar faces, putting your best self forward, and discovering that most people you will encounter are in search for the very same thing: Connections that count.</p>

								<p class="_small"><em>To get the most out of this networking class, we would request that attendees wear clothing that would fit a "dressy casual" setting. This optional attire will help reinforce concepts to be covered, including appropriate clothing for job interviews and various professional settings. (Ie. For men: Seasonal sports coat or blazer for men, dress shirt or polo shirt, and no jeans. For women: Dress, skirt and dressy top, or dressy pants outfit, and no jeans.)</em></p>

							<p><strong>What is <em>Beyond Coding</em>?</strong></p>
							<p><em>Beyond Coding</em> is a free new summer program that sets out to equip emerging computer programmers in New York City with professional skills needed to help them succeed in their first job working with code. The program, slated to launch June 11, is a direct response to the City's Tech Talent Pipeline efforts to grow  our local tech ecosystem.. <em>Beyond Coding</em> is launching as a joint partnership among six companies in New York City’s startup ecosystem: Crest CC, Foursquare, Kickstarter, Tumblr, Trello, and Stack Overflow.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><strong>Why was this program created in New York City?</strong></p>
							<p>With nearly <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/12/31/hiring-and-hirable-in-2013-agile-developers/" target="_blank">five open jobs</a> for every available software developer, the need for qualified technical talent is higher than ever. In New York City alone, there are currently <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/114-15/mayor-bill-de-blasio-nyc-tech-talent-pipeline-industry-partners-commitments-to" target="_blank">13,000 firms</a> hiring for highly sought-after skills, such as web development, mobile development, and user-interface design. To meet this demand, it’s critical to rapidly onboard more software developers to the workforce.</p>
